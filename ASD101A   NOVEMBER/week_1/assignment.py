# 1. Write Python code that prompts the user to enter his or her height and assigns the user’s input to a variable named height.

height = input("what is your height")

# 2. Write Python code that prompts the user to enter his or her favorite color and assigns the user’s input to a variable named color.
color = input("what is your favorite color? ")

# 3. Write assignment statements that perform the following operations with the variables a, b, and c:

# Adds 2 to a and assigns the result to b
# Multiplies b times 4 and assigns the result to a
# Divides a by 3.14 and assigns the result to b
# Subtracts 8 from b and assigns the result to a

a = int(input("pick a number for the variable a"))
b = a + 2
a = b * 4
b = a / 3.14 
a = b - 8


# 4. Assume the variables result, w, x, y, and z are all integers, and that w = 5, x = 4, y = 8, and z = 2. What value will be stored in result after each of the following statements execute?

# result = x + y = 12
# result = z * 2 = 4
# result = y / x = 2.0
# result = y – z = 6
# result = w // z = 2

# 5. Write a Python statement that assigns the sum of 10 and 14 to the variable total.

total = 10 + 14
# 6. Write a Python statement that subtracts the variable down_payment from the variable total and assigns the result to the variable due.

down_payment = float(input)("what is the downpayment amount ? ")
due = total - down_payment

# 7. Write a Python statement that multiplies the variable subtotal by 0.15 and assigns the result to the variable total.

subtotal = 7
total = subtotal * 0.15

# 8. What would the following display?

#  a = 5
#  b = 2
#  c = 3
#  result = a + b * c
#  print(result)

# 11

# 9. What would the following display?

#  num = 99
#  num = 5
#  print(num)

# 5

# 12. What will the following statement display?

#  print('George', 'John', 'Paul', 'Ringo', sep='@')

# George@John@Paul@Ringo
