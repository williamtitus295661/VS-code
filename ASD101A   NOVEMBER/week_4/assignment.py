# 1) Write a function named times_ten. The function should accept an argument and display the product of its argument multiplied times 10.
def times_ten(number):
    print(number *10)


# 2) Examine the following function header, then write a statement that calls the function, passing 12 as an argument.
#  def show_value(quantity):
# show_value(12)


# 3) Look at the following function header:header, then write a statement that calls the function, passing 12 as an argument. def my_function(a, b, c):
# Now look at the following call to my_function:



# #  my_function(3, 2, 1)
# When this call executes, what value will be assigned to a? What value will be assigned to b? What value will be assigned to c?

# a= 3, b = 2, c =1



# 4) What will the following program display?

#  def main():
    #  x = 1
    #  y = 3.4
    #  print(x, y)
    #  change_us(x, y)
