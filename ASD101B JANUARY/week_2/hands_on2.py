# Outline three different ways a programmer should use to find and fix syntax errors. (Hints: Google, Documentation and Debugger)

# Provide a coding example for each example. 


# 1.code editor, 2. read the error messages, 3.use debugger
# 1. A code editor can help you spot syntax errors by highlighting them in different colors, suggesting possible corrections, and showing you 
# where the error occured. here is an example what a code with errors
# would look like.

# def play_games_when I'm done
# for game in play_games_when
# if doom_eternal 
# print("I'm not here to play I'm here to slay!  ") 
# there would be 3 highlights here. and if you hovered over them 
# it would tell you what it expected and give suggestions on what to replace with.

#2. Another way to Identify and resolve syntax errors is to
# read the error messages that your code generates when you try 
# to run it.An example would look like this
#   SyntaxError: Unexpected token ')' at line 5.   
# that means you are missing parenthesis in your code at line 5.

# 3. A debugger can help you identify and resolve syntax errors by
# showing you how your code behaves and where it fails.  You
# can use a debugger to find logical errors, such as incorrect
# calculations, that are not detected by syntax highlighting or error messages.
